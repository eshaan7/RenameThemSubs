## How to Use

1. I compiled the python script using <a href="https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller">pyinstaller</a> and converted it into a standalone windows executable(.exe). It is included in the [repo's release](https://github.com/Eshaan7/RenameThemSubs/releases/) and can be found <a href="https://mega.nz/#!iihUTCzR!rAQdsCsZfveJbYgwMD0JX4OymIpHlAmnbhYT1A6pIpE"><b>here</b></a> as well.

2. This is now also available as a web application. https://RenameThemSubs.herokuapp.com/
   (For some unknown reason, It only works on Google Chrome for now)

3. git clone this repo and directly run `python3 renamethemsubs.py`

## What the script does
You download a TV show from torrent and find the suitable subtitle files from some website.
Renaming every subtitle file to match the video file is a pain in the ass, isn't it?
That's where this script comes in handy.

## Motivation behind such a silly project
A few years back I would often have to manually rename all subtitle files to match episode name and I always wondered why isn't there a
software that does it for you ? Well, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzWNBmjyv7Y">fine, I'll do it myself.</a>
